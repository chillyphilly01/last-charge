<h1>1. Install OpenSSH</h1>
<p>OpenSSH is installed by default in some versions of Windows 10 and all versions of Windows 11.
You can check if it is installed by running the terminal command: <code>ssh -V</code> or by opening Settings&rarr;Apps&rarr;Optional Features
then looking for OpenSSH Client in the list.</p>
</p>If it is not installed select it in the list and click Install or follow the instrustions on the Microsoft website
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui" target="_blank">Get started with OpenSSH for Windows</a></p>
<h1>2. Create SSH keypair for Github</h1>
<p>Basically follow these instructions <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=windows#generating-a-new-ssh-key" target="_blank">Generating a new SSH key</a>
 Open the Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter the command <code>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"</code> and
 follow the prompts. The defaults should be fine, add a password for the key if you like. This should have created a public and private key file in your users .ssh folder
  'id_ed25519.pub' and 'id_ed15519'.</p>
<h1>3. Add key to ssh-agent</h1>
<p>The ssh agent is used to manage ssh keys, first the service must be started. Open an admin Terminal, Command Prompt or PowerShell and
enter the commands <code>Get-Service ssh-agent | Select StartType</code> if it doesn't say Automatic enter 
<code>Get-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic</code>
<br>Now add the private key to the ssh-agent with the command <code>ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519</code> If you created the key with a passcode you will have to enter it now.
Delete the private key file.</p>
<h1>4. Add the public key to Github</h1>
<p>Go to the SSH and GPG keys section of your Github profile and click New SSH key, the enter a descriptive name and copy the contents of the
 'id_ed25519.pub' into the Key text box. Click Add.</p>
<h1>5. Test Connection to Github</h1>
<p>We now need to check that adding the key has worked and will allow you to authenticate with Github.<br>
This is essentially the instructions here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection" target="_blank">Testing your SSH connection</a><br>
Open a Terminal, Command Prompt or PowerShell and enter the command <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> If this is the first time you are doing this you will 
see a warning, type yes. You should then see a message saying that you have authenticated.</p>
<h1>Install Git</h1>
<p>Enter the command <code>winget install Git.Git</code> Git should now be installed.<br>
We now need to tell Git to use Windows built in OpenSSH, rather then the SSH client included with the Git install. Enter the command in a terminal <code>
git config --global core.sshcommand C:/Windows/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe</code><br>
You should now be able to clone Git repositories from Github using SSH on windows.</p>
