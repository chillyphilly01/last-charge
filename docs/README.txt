This project has been created becuase I needed a charger for NiMH AA batteries and couldn't find one with the features that I wanted.
So as an electrical engineer who doesn't know any better, I thought I would just make one myself!

I am only just starting on this project and it will likely take multiple versions to get to a point where I am happy.
As the project name suggests, the goal is that the final version of this charger should be the last AA and AAA battery charger you will ever need.
